I mean, we have a pool, netflix, ps4, an awesome staff, throw random bbq parties, or just chill in a hammock, and so much more.</p>
          <p>Ocean Tigers Dive Hostel is also an escape from the tourism, city noise, and hustling. But, with that being said we are no more than a walking distance away from the party, beach, and restaurants.

          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p>Ocean Tigers Dive Hostel, a Hostel for people that want to get into or already have an interest in diving or freediving in the Cabo San Lucas area of Baja California. The Dive Hostel was founded in 2015 by two friends, one French and the other Japanese. With their love of diving and travel, they launched the grand opening of the dive hostel on January 1st of 2016.</p>
          <p>Prior to forming Ocean Tigers Hostel. Michael Guild, the other founder, also ended up falling in love with the sport. In a search for proper training and education, Michael stumbled upon Ben in Cabo San Lucas. At the time, Ben was only one of wt AIDA Certified Instructors in all of Mexico. Afterwards Ben and Michael became friends; And thus, Ocean Tigers Hostel was formed in Cabo. Why do people want to learn how to free dive?</p>

          <h3>Freediving With Ocean Tigers In Cabo</h3>
          <p>Ocean Tigers Hostel, Is A Hostel Located In Cabo San Lucas With A Focus On Freediving. Ocean Tigers Hostel was founded by one of the very first AIDA Instructors, Benoit Frachet. Ben, growing up in Nice, France, started freediving in 1997 just a few years after AIDA was formed. From a very young age, Ben fell in love with the sport and ended up traveling around the world sharing his passions. With his speciality in freediving, in the Cabo San Lucas area, Ocean Tigers offers decades of freediving instructional experience from casual to formal freediving in AIDA or PADI Certifications.</p>

          <h3>Why Freediving?</h3>
          <p>Why freediving?” many ask. Why do you want to hold your breath until your body is screaming for air and see how far you can go, when you can strap a scuba tank on your back and go as far as you want? Well, freediving is not at all like this! It is not about your body screaming for air and not about suffering for lack of oxygen. Freedivers don’t come back from a dive looking like they are about to suffocate, but most of the time they break the surface with a big smile stamped on their face.</p>
          <p>Why are they smiling? That is hard to explain to people who have never tried it! The feeling of gliding in the blue water, the feeling of being at peace submerged in this big vast liquid world, the feeling of becoming a sea creature, the feeling of belonging that makes us almost remember our real aquatic origins; all of this condensed in a 1 or 2 minutes experience, makes it very hard not to smile!</p>
